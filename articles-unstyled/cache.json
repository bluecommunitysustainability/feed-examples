This one was special thanks to grandparents coming to visit which allowed my wife and I to escape to a hotel for a night. A small relief to be off parenting duty for ~18 hours after fourteen months of so much parenting. We ate Korean food, drank cocktails, and watched Deadpool in our hotel room. A tranquil birthday.\nApril was a bit of a hangover from March work-wise. My project load carried over and, while they’re all great projects, I found myself working in my spare time on the larger side projects to feel caught up. This is less than ideal but the energy-stress tradeoff was intentional.

The YouTube gods smiled up me and surfaced a channel called DUST, a massive collection sci-fi short films. The quality is much better than what you might expect from “free sci-fi” but one of their films, The OceanMaker, is an absolute standout that raptured me and took me somewhere I’ve never been.\nExtrapolating on the near future Water Wars, The OceanMaker is a beautiful animated film that imagines a world where humans fight over every drop of water — even clouds. The hero is a brave, young inventor with her heart set on changing the world with her invention. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but the film captures the real world tension between selfish, exploitative “biggest wins” capitalism and the need to invest in science and technology, all inside a package filled with sorrow, hope, and dogfights.\nI hope you enjoy it.",
