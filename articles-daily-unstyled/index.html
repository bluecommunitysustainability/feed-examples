          <p>I turned 41 at the end of April. Another pandemic birthday in the books. This one was special thanks to grandparents coming to visit which allowed my wife and I to escape to a hotel for a night. A small relief to be off parenting duty for ~18 hours after fourteen months of so much parenting. We ate Korean food, drank cocktails, and watched Deadpool in our hotel room. A tranquil birthday.
April was a bit of a hangover from March work-wise. My project load carried over and, while they’re all great projects, I found myself working in my spare time on the larger side projects to feel caught up. This is less than ideal but the energy-stress tradeoff was intentional. I’m working on quantifying and minimizing the work I do, but that’s hard to do when you run your own business and are building a s…</p>

          <p>There’s two features I look for in good sci-fi: 1. something I hadn’t imagined before and 2. something that anticipates the automobile, as well as the traffic jam. The YouTube gods smiled up me and surfaced a channel called DUST, a massive collection sci-fi short films. The quality is much better than what you might expect from “free sci-fi” but one of their films, The OceanMaker, is an absolute standout that raptured me and took me somewhere I’ve never been.
Extrapolating on the near future Water Wars, The OceanMaker is a beautiful animated film that imagines a world where humans fight over every drop of water — even clouds. The hero is a brave, young inventor with her heart set on changing the world with her invention. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but the film captures the real world tension between selfish, exploitative “biggest wins” capitalism and the need to invest in science and technology, all inside a package filled with sorrow, hope, and dogfights.
I hope you enjoy it.</p>
