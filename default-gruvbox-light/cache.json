          "description": "Beyond the severe toll of the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps no other disruption has transformed user experiences quite like how the tethers to our formerly web-biased era of content have frayed. We’re transitioning to a new world of remote work and digital content. We’re also experimenting with unprecedented content channels that, not too long ago, elicited chuckles at the watercooler, like voice interfaces, digital signage, augmented reality, and virtual reality.\nMany factors are responsible. Perhaps it’s …",

All you need to do is inform potential buyers about your product or service.&nbsp;\nYour website is a good place to introduce your product or service outside your locale. Localizing your web content sounds like the right way to reach out to the global market. Localization will bridge the language barriers, or the wider scope of differing cultures.&nbsp;\nBefore we move on further with the discussion, let’s focus on the definition of “localization.”&nbsp;\nWhat i…",

          "description": "I turned 41 at the end of April. Another pandemic birthday in the books. This one was special thanks to grandparents coming to visit which allowed my wife and I to escape to a hotel for a night. A small relief to be off parenting duty for ~18 hours after fourteen months of so much parenting. We ate Korean food, drank cocktails, and watched Deadpool in our hotel room. A tranquil birthday.\nApril was a bit of a hangover from March work-wise. My project load carried over and, while they’re all great projects, I…",

The YouTube gods smiled up me and surfaced a channel called DUST, a massive collection sci-fi short films. The quality is much better than what you might expect from “free sci-fi” but one of their films, The OceanMaker, is an absolute standout that raptured me and took me somewhere I’ve never been.\nExtrapolating on the near future Water Wars, The…",
