                    <span>From Fall 2020 to Spring 2021 I gave a talk about backlogs. It’s based on the story of the time someone assigned me 313 accessibility issues from an offshore audit. I believe every developer –at some point in their career– finds themselves pinned beneath a weighty backlog and because it’s such a universal experience, part of the job, I think it’s a topic worth discussing more frequently. And the parallel to a physical log jam was a portmanteau too perfect to pass up.
In the talk I explore how to break down work in a large backlog and introduce a tactic that I call “multidimensional audits”. There’s value in moving issues out of the bug tracker and into modern day spreadsheet tools so you can visualize your large problems from different angles. This helps make the backlog more digestible an…</span>

                    <span>Whenever my family attempts a major buying decision (TV, couch, computer, remodel, shed, dining table, etc) we’re inevitably confronted with a choice between two options:
The perfect, more expensive, but out-of-stock option
The less perfect, less expensive, in-stock option
This spins us out in a quandary of self-doubt. From the soul-seeking “Do we love it $700 more?”, to the hopefully naïve “What if they update it this year and it’s perfect?”, to the downright existential “Are we $700 more people?” We hem and haw, spinning around the issue like two black holes hoping to collide on a single opinion.
Almost always, we go with option two; the less perfect, less expensive, but in-stock option. Perhaps it’s us giving into impulsiveness, but there’s a small joy in walking away with a physical, tangible box or a tracking link instead of a lousy 12-digit order confirmation number. Even though we have enough datapoints to predict our behavior, we find ourselves in the same predicament over and over. Which path to take? Which path brings the most happiness? Which path is the secret to a happy lifestyle?
I know people who do the perfect, more expensive, but out-of-stock so they have to wait option and they seem happy with their perfect, expensive goods. But they must have a level of patience or perfection I do not. Did they perform better at the marshmallow experiment? Not that we’re unhappy with our on-time, lower grade wares. But I wonder what would happen if we were the people who went all out, exhausted the budget, and then waited weeks or months for the Platonic ideal to arrive. Eight more gigabytes. Eight more horsepower. Eight more threads per inch. Eight more florps. It must be worth it. It must be.</span>

                    <span>One of my favorite game studios, Double Fine Productions, hosts and documents their internal 2-week game jam which they call “Amnesia Fortnight”. While it may be stressful for a small company to stop production on their monetization pipeline, Double Fine sees it as a way to test out “experimental” ideas and give people who aren’t game directors a shot at directing a game. A chance for people to play a different or larger role than what they typically perform. It also provides employees a break from the daily grind.
I love the ethos of game jams because they force you to distill an idea down to its essence. The goal isn’t to have a polished, marketable product at the end, it’s to have something people can play. There’s a small plan, a lot of improv, and a lot of self-editing. If you can’t r…</span>

Work continues to be busy, a constant refrain, but this past half-year has been some of the hardest I’ve worked in my whole life. The tl;dr is that it’s hard to build a startup and do client projects at the same time. On top of that this month my wife and I are refinancing our house. Refinancing your house as a self-employed person is a special kind of hell with a heaping amount of extra “ASAP!”-type work added to your busy schedule.
The refinance is temporary and should die down soon and I’m finding some work boundaries and systems that help me organize my work week on a meta level (e.g. I work on project X  on day Y). Speaking candidly, it hasn’t been a great month for me but I do get to work with great p…</span>
